#How-It-Works
1. Game Rules:
=> The game starts by flashing a color (let’s call it “Color A”) to the player.
=> Your task is to remember this color.
=> In each subsequent level, the game adds another color (“Color B,” “Color C,” and so on) to the sequence.
=> Your challenge is to recall the entire sequence of colors from memory.
2. Player Interaction:
=> After the sequence is displayed, click on the colors in the same order they were shown.
=> If you get the sequence right, you’ll advance to the next level.
=> But be careful! If you make a mistake, the game ends, and you’ll need to click the “Start” button to play again.
3. Scoring:
=> The game keeps track of your highest score (the highest level you reached).
=> Your current level (or score) is displayed during gameplay.
